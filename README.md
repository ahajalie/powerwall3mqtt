# powerwall3mqtt
A simple Home Assistant Add On that acts as a bridge between the Powerwall 3 TEDAPI and MQTT. This forked modification of the original source now allows a polling interval to be set to as low as 1 second, and reduces the cache to 1 second. This enables realtime monitoring updates within 1-2 seconds.

## Current state
- Powerwall 3 local access requires a direct connection to the TeslaPW_XXXXX WiFi network.  The device running this add-on must have an IP from that network, which is 192.168.91.x/24.  A wired ethernet connection *will not work*.
- The bridge can deal with a single group of one or more Powerwall 3s.  It might also support expansion units, but I have none to test with.
- Power reporting is working for the following:
	- Aggregates of the entire system
	- Individual PV strings on each PW3
- Energy storage reporting is working for the following:
	- Aggregate of all batteries
	- Individual Powerwall battery levels
	- Calculations of percentage remaining and user defined backup reserve mirror the Tesla app
- No other energy reporting
	- Pypowerwall doesn't have it yet, and so far it appears it may not be possible
	- The Energy Dashboard can be supported by manually creating 6 Integral helpers.  The steps as of 2025-02-24 are:
		- Enable the 4 power input/output entities listed below.  They are disabled by default.
			- Battery Power Charge
			- Battery Power Discharge
			- Grid Power Import
			- Grid Power Export
		- Create 6 Integral Helpers in Settings, Integrations, Helpers
			- Each should be a Left Riemann sum
			- You should create one for each for the following sensors:
				- Battery Power Charge (name it Battery Energy Charged)
				- Battery Power Discharge (name it Battery Energy Discharged)
				- Grid Power Import (name it Grid Energy Imported)
				- Grid Power Export (name it Grid Energy Exported)
				- Load Power (name it Load Energy Used)
				- Solar Power (name is Solar Energy Produced)
- No interactivity support
	- Can't tell the system to go Off-Grid
	- Can't change settings on the Powerwall
	- I'm planning to work on these later this year when I'm on-site where my PW3 install is

## Pre-reqs
**Starting with firmware 25.10.1, the only known way to communicate with the TEDAPI is using the TeslaPW_XXXXX WiFi network.**
If your HA server is within range of the PW you can join it directly, but otherwise you'd need to create some kind of bridge, which is beyond the scope of this project.

## Reporting problems
- Please switch the Logging Level to DEBUG in Configuration and restart the add-on.
	- You may need to toggle "Show unused optional configuration options" on.
- Open an issue at https://github.com/slyglif/powerwall3mqtt/issues
	- Describe the issue you are encountering
	- Include the version of HA and HAOS
	- Include the version of the add-on
	- Include the IP address for HAOS.  Problem reports without this will be closed.
	- Include the logs
		- Include the full logs if possible
		- If the full logs are megabytes in size, at least the first 20 lines at startup and the 10 lines prior to the error
		- If including the logs inline, please quote them between "\`\`\`" marks (3 backticks)
